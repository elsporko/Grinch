Grinch is a tool built to assist with my son's annual boy scout Christmas Tree pickup fundraiser. The idea is to supplement the current CRUD application that allows customers to request a pickup for the upcoming event. The legacy aopolication produces route sheets that are handed out to the volunteers. Over the past few years the route sheets have been turned into online maps to allow for ease of navigation and planning out paths.

The process requires lots of manual intervention including distributing routes to teams, importing route data into existinng applications, and reporting any issues while working the route (no tree, no donation, tree left for pickup, but not on currently scheduled for pickup, etc). The grinch application looks to automate the manual steps as well as to add other useful features. Grinch looks to provide a consistent replacement for existing map fechnologies whose useful features may disappear.

Admin users will be able to access the portal that allows:
    * user amanagement 
        * see all users
        * create new users 
        * deactivate exixting users.
        * Group users by route
    * route management:
        * Recieve routes from legacy app via API
        * Assign users/user groups to routes
        * View routes as pinned map data
        * Manipulate the connection between routes and groups - This can be done between non-admin users as well
    *  view log transactions:
        * group reassignment
        * Field issues reported

Standard users:
    * route management
        * View and interact with addresses that have been assinged to their group
        *
